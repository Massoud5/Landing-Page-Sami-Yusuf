What I learned:

- To add video from youtube and changing its dimension.

- To use nav-links in header and in footer

- I used my creativity for the style and the emplacement of the contents. 

- I encountered a serious problem: 
    I added twice similar video to have a little video dimension for the little viewport and a bigger video dimention for a bigger viewport.
    But when I play the video in little view, it don't stop automatically when I enlarge the navigator's window and reverse.
    Unfortunately I couldn't resolve it.
